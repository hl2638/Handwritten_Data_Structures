# Handwritten_Data_Structures

In competitive programming, there are some complicated data structures and algorithms that are relatively easy to understand but harder to implement.
To get familiar with using them, I decided to implement some of them.

I'll start with segment tree for now, since it's really easy to understand but not so easy to implement successfully on one go.
